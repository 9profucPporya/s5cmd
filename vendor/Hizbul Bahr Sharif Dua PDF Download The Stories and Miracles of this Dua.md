# Hizbul Bahr Sharif Dua: A Powerful Litany of the Sea
 
Hizbul Bahr Sharif Dua is a famous invocation attributed to Imam Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili, the founder of the Shadhili Sufi order. It is also known as the Litany of the Sea, because it was revealed to Imam Shadhili in a dream by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) when he was on a ship that was stranded by weak winds. The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught him this dua and instructed him to recite it daily. As soon as Imam Shadhili recited it, a strong wind blew and carried the ship to its destination.
 
The Hizbul Bahr Sharif Dua consists of Quranic verses and prophetic supplications that are meant to protect the reciter from all kinds of harm and evil, as well as grant him spiritual benefits and blessings. It is a comprehensive dua that covers various aspects of life, such as movements, rests, words, desires, thoughts, doubts, fears, hopes, and secrets. It is also a dua of praise and gratitude to Allah, the Most High, the Most Great, the Most Clement, and the Most Knowing.
